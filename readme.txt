#### This plugin is addons of Gutenberg Page Builder
The Plus Addons for Gutenberg provides additional and customized blocks for [Gutenberg Page Builder](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) which is provided by Wordpress as a default page editor in their recent updates.

Make sure you are using [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) which is a default page editor, not Classic editor which was default one in previous versions (Below 5.0) of Wordpress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Gutenberg required to use this plugin ? =

Well Gutenberg is kind of the default page editor for Wordpress version 5.0 and further. So if you haven’t messed up with default page builder settings, you don’t need any installations. However if you have, then go and download [Gutenberg Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/), install it and keep it activated.

= Will it work with all themes out there ? =

Yes definitely ! We have designed the blocks to have compatibility with all the themes out there and we have made tags and CSS structure non-conflict in manner so that you can enjoy designing web sites in your own flow regardless of worrying about theme.

However we are specially designing a Theme for all of our addons which would be lightweight and you can take out most of it without any extra efforts, so stay tuned for it !

= Will it add a bloat and slow down my website ? =

Absolutely not. Keeping in mind the development issues, we have tried to add as few as possible HTML tags. We have also managed the auto generation of styles on condition of activation and all the things that can save up space and act faster. So nothing to worry about.
